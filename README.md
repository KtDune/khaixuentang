# Website — README

Short description
This directory contains the source for a small website. It includes the HTML, CSS, JavaScript and assets needed to view and build the site.

Getting started
- Open `index.html` in a browser to view the site locally (if present).
- If the project uses a build tool, run:
    - git clone <repo>
    - npm install
    - npm run dev   (or `npm run start` / `npm run build` depending on setup)

Typical structure
- /index.html — main entry (if present)
- /src or /app — source files (HTML, templates, JS, CSS)
- /assets or /public — images, fonts, icons
- /dist or /build — build output (generated)

Development notes
- Keep styles in a single CSS/SCSS folder where possible.
- Keep JavaScript modular and importable for the build tool in use.
- Update paths in HTML when moving or renaming assets.

Deployment
- Build (if applicable) and upload the contents of `/dist` or the repository root to your static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).

Contributing
- Open an issue or submit a pull request for changes.
- Follow repository coding style and run any linters/tests before submitting.

License
- Add a LICENSE file to state the project license.

If you want, provide the project stack or package files (package.json, build config) and a more specific README will be generated.
